<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This avocado ice cream is made with coconut milk, agave, lemon juice, and lime. It tastes a little like key lime pie; the avocado just adds silkiness and color. It's my favorite non-dairy ice cream! It's rich, creamy, vegan, and free of refined sugars. It's 
        even more delicious sprinkled with toasted shredded coconut!</p>
